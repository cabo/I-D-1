  <t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and related extensions are intended to support machine-to-machine communication in systems where one or more nodes are resource constrained, in particular for low power wireless sensor networks. This document defines a publish-subscribe broker for CoAP that extends the capabilities of CoAP for supporting nodes with long breaks in connectivity and/or up-time.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"/> supports machine-to-machine communication across networks of constrained devices. CoAP uses a request/response model where clients make requests to servers in order to request actions on resources. Depending on the situation the same device may act either as a server or a client. </t>

<t>One important class of constrained devices includes devices that are intended to run for years from a small battery, or by scavenging energy from their environment. These devices have limited reachability because they spend most of their time in a sleeping state with no network connectivity. Devices may also have limited reachability due to certain middle-boxes, such as Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls. Such middle-boxes often prevent connecting to a device from the Internet unless the connection was initiated by the device. </t>

<t>This document specifies the means for nodes with limited reachability to communicate using simple extensions to CoAP. The extensions enable publish-subscribe communication using a broker node that enables store-and-forward messaging between two or more nodes. Furthermore the extensions facilitate many-to-many communication using CoAP. </t>

<!--
<t>The mechanisms specified in this document are meant to address key design requirements from earlier CoRE drafts covering sleepy node support and mirror server. </t>

<section title="Terminology">
   <t>The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
   
   <t>This specification requires readers to be familiar with all the terms and concepts that are discussed in <xref target="RFC5988"/> and <xref target="RFC6690"/>. Readers should also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed in <xref target="RFC7252"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/>. The URI template format <xref target="RFC6570"/> is used to describe the REST interfaces defined in this specification.</t>

<t>This specification makes use of the following additional terminology:
<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Publish-Subscribe (pub-sub):">A messaging paradigm where messages are published to a broker and potential receivers can subscribe to the broker to receive messages. The publishers do not (need to) know where the message will be eventually sent: the publications and subscriptions are matched by a broker and publications are delivered by the broker to subscribed receivers. </t>

<section title="CoAP-PubSub Architecture">

<t><xref target="arch-fig"/> shows the architecture of a CoAP PubSub service. CoAP PubSub Clients interact with a CoAP PubSub Broker through the CoAP PubSub interface which is hosted by the Broker. State information is updated between the Clients and the Broker. The CoAP PubSub Broker performs a store-and-forward function of state updates between certain CoAP PubSub Clients. Clients Subscribe to state updates which are Published by other Clients, and which are forwarded by the Broker to the subscribing clients. The CoAP PubSub Broker also acts as a REST proxy, retaining the last state update provided by clients to supply in response to Read requests from Clients.

<section title="CoAP PubSub Broker">
<t>A CoAP PubSub Broker is a CoAP Server that exposes an interface for clients to use to initiate publish-subscribe interactions.
</t>

</section>

<section title="CoAP PubSub Client">
<t>A CoAP PubSub Client interacts with a CoAP PubSub Broker using the CoAP PubSub interface. Clients initiate all interactions with the CoAP-PubSub broker. Sensor Clients Publish state updates to the Broker. Actuator Clients read from or subscribe to state updates from the broker. Application clients make use of both publish and subscribe in order to exchange state updates with Sensors and Actuators.</t>

</section> 


<section title="CoAP PubSub Topic">
<t>A  PubSub Topic is a string used to identify a particular resource or object in a publish-subscribe system. Topics are conventionally formed as a hierarchy, e.g. "/sensors/weather/barometer/pressure" or "EP-33543/sen/3303/0/5700".</t>

<section anchor="function-set" title="CoAP PubSub Function Set">
<t>This section is normative.
</t>
<t>This section defines the interfaces between a CoAP PubSub Broker and PubSub Clients, which is called the CoAP PubSub Function Set. The examples throughout this section assume the use of CoAP [RFC7252]. A CoAP PubSub Broker implementing this specification MUST support the DISCOVER, CREATE, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, READ, and REMOVE operations defined in this section. With the exception of PUBLISH, all operations in the CoAP PubSub Function Set MUST use confirmable (CON) CoAP messages.
</t>

<section title="DISCOVER">
<t> CoAP PubSub Clients discover CoAP PubSub Brokers by using CoAP Simple Discovery or through Resource Directory. A CoAP PubSub Broker MAY indicate its presence and availability on a network by exposing a link to its PubSub function set at its .well-known/core location. A CoAP PubSub broker MAY register its PubSub function set location with a Resource Directory. <xref target="discover-fig"/> shows an example of a client discovering a local PubSub Function Set using CoAP Simple Discovery. A broker wishing to advertise the CoAP PubSub Function Set for Simple Discovery or through a Resource Directory MUST use the link relation rt="core.ps".
</t>

<t>The DISCOVER interface is specified as follows:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Interaction:">Client -> Broker</t>
<t hangText="Method:">GET</t>
<t hangText="URI Template:">/.well-known/core{?rt}</t>

</list>
</t>
<t hangText="Content-Format:">application/link-format (if any)</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>The following response codes are defined for this interface:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Success:"> 2.05 "Content" with an
application/link-format payload containing one or more matching entries for the broker resource. A PubSub broker SHOULD use the value "ps" for the link subject variable whenever possible.</t>
<t hangText="Failure:"> 4.04 "Not Found" is returned in case no matching entry is found for a unicast request.</t>
<t hangText="Failure:"> 4.00 "Bad Request" is returned in case of a malformed request for a unicast request.</t>
<t hangText="Failure:"> No error response to a multicast request.</t>

<t>A CoAP PubSub client wishing to obtain the most recent published value on a topic MAY Read the value from the broker. A client wishing to READ a topic from a broker MUST use the CoAP GET operation. The Broker MUST return a response code of 2.05 Content along with the most recently published value if the topic contains a valid value. If the topic was PUBLISHed with the max-age option, the broker MUST set the max-age option in the valid response to the amount of time remaining for the topic to be valid since the last PUBLISH. The Broker MUST return a response code of 2.04 No Content if the max-age of the previously stored value has expired. The Broker MUST return a response code 4.04 Not Found if the topic does not exist or has been REMOVEd.

<section anchor="SecurityConsiderations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>CoAP-PubSub re-uses CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/>, CoRE Resource Directory <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/>, and Web Linking <xref target="RFC5988"/> and therefore the security considerations of those documents also apply to this specification. Additionally, a CoAP-PubSub broker and the clients SHOULD authenticate each other and enforce access control policies. A malicious client could subscribe to data it is not authorized to or mount a denial of service attack against the broker by publishing a large number of resources. The authentication can be performed using the already standardized DTLS offered mechanisms, such as certificates. DTLS also allows communication security to be established to ensure integrity and confidentiality protection of the data exchanged between these relevant parties. Provisioning the necessary credentials, trust anchors and authorization policies is non-trivial and subject of ongoing work.</t>

<t>The use of a CoAP-PubSub broker introduces challenges for the use of end-to-end security between for example a client device on a sensor network and a client application running in a cloud-based server infrastructure since brokers terminate the exchange. While running separate DTLS sessions from the client device to the broker and from broker to client application protects confidentially on those paths, the client device does not know whether the commands coming from the broker are actually coming from the client application. Similarly, a client application requesting data does not know whether the data originated on the client device. For scenarios where end-to-end security is desirable the use of application layer security is unavoidable. Application layer security would then provide a guarantee to the client device that any request originated at the client application. Similarly, integrity protected sensor data from a client device will also provide guarantee to the client application that the data originated on the client device itself. The protected data can also be verified by the intermediate broker ensuring that it stores/caches correct request/response and no malicious messages/requests are accepted. The broker would still be able to perform aggregation of data/requests collected.</t>

<t>Depending on the level of trust users and system designers place in the CoAP-PubSub broker, the use of end-to-end encryption may also be envisioned. The CoAP-PubSub broken would then only be able to verify the request/response message/commands and store-and-forward without being able to inspect the content. The solution for providing application layer security will depend on the utilized data encoding. For example, with a JSON-based data encoding the work from the JOSE working group could be re-used. Distribution of the credentials for accomplishing end-to-end security might introduce challenges if previously unknown parties need to exchange data.</t>
