  <t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and related extensions are intended to support machine-to-machine communication in systems where one or more nodes are resource constrained, in particular for low power wireless sensor networks. This document defines a publish-subscribe broker for CoAP that extends the capabilities of CoAP for supporting nodes with long breaks in connectivity and/or up-time.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"/> supports machine-to-machine communication across networks of constrained devices. CoAP uses a request/response model where clients make requests to servers in order to request actions on resources. Depending on the situation the same device may act either as a server or a client. </t>

<t>One important class of constrained devices includes devices that are intended to run for years from a small battery, or by scavenging energy from their environment. These devices have limited reachability because they spend most of their time in a sleeping state with no network connectivity. Devices may also have limited reachability due to certain middle-boxes, such as Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls. Such middle-boxes often prevent connecting to a device from the Internet unless the connection was initiated by the device. </t>

<t>This document specifies the means for nodes with limited reachability to communicate using simple extensions to CoAP. The extensions enable publish-subscribe communication using a broker node that enables store-and-forward messaging between two or more nodes. Furthermore the extensions facilitate many-to-many communication using CoAP. </t>

<!--
<t>The mechanisms specified in this document are meant to address key design requirements from earlier CoRE drafts covering sleepy node support and mirror server. </t>

<section title="CoAP pub/sub Architecture">

<t><xref target="arch-fig"/> shows the architecture of a CoAP pub/sub service. CoAP pub/sub Clients interact with a CoAP pub/sub Broker through the CoAP pub/sub interface which is hosted by the Broker. State information is updated between the Clients and the Broker. The CoAP pub/sub Broker performs a store-and-forward function of state updates between certain CoAP pub/sub Clients. Clients Subscribe to state updates which are Published by other Clients, and which are forwarded by the Broker to the subscribing clients. The CoAP pub/sub Broker also acts as a REST proxy, retaining the last state update provided by clients to supply in response to Read requests from Clients.

<section title="CoAP pub/sub Broker">
<t>A CoAP pub/sub Broker is a CoAP Server that exposes an interface for clients to use to initiate publish-subscribe interactions. Unlike clients, the broker needs to be reachable by all clients. The broker also needs to have sufficient resources (storage, bandwidth, etc.) to host CoAP resources, and potentially buffer messages, on behalf of the clients.
</t>

</section>

<section title="CoAP pub/sub Client">
<t>A CoAP pub/sub Client interacts with a CoAP pub/sub Broker using the CoAP pub/sub interface. Clients initiate all interactions with the CoAP pub/sub broker. A data source (e.g., sensor clients) can publish state updates to the broker and data sinks (e.g., actuator clients) can read from or subscribe to state updates from the broker. Application clients can make use of both publish and subscribe in order to exchange state updates with data sources and sinks.</t>

</section> 


<section title="CoAP pub/sub Topic">
<t>The clients and broker use topics to identify a particular resource or object in a publish-subscribe system. Topics are conventionally formed as a hierarchy, e.g. "/sensors/weather/barometer/pressure" or "EP-33543/sen/3303/0/5700". The topics are hosted at the broker and all the clients using the broker share the same namespace for topics. A CoAP pub/sub topic has a reference path using URI path <xref target="RFC3986"/> construction, link attributes <xref target="RFC6690"/>, and a representation of a value with specified content-formats. A CoAP pub/sub topic value may alternatively be a collection of one or more sub-topics, consisting of links to the sub-topic URIs and indicated by a link-format content-format.</t>

</section>

</section>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<section anchor="function-set" title="CoAP pub/sub Function Set">

<t>This section defines the interfaces between a CoAP pub/sub Broker and pub/sub Clients, which is called the CoAP pub/sub Function Set. The examples throughout this section assume the use of CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/>. A CoAP pub/sub Broker implementing this specification MUST support the DISCOVER, CREATE, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, READ, and REMOVE operations defined in this section.
</t>

<section title="DISCOVER">
<t> CoAP pub/sub Clients discover CoAP pub/sub Brokers by using CoAP Simple Discovery or through a Resource Directory (RD) <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/>. A CoAP pub/sub Broker SHOULD indicate its presence and availability on a network by exposing a link to its pub/sub function set at its .well-known/core location <xref target="RFC6690"/>. A CoAP pub/sub broker MAY register its pub/sub function set location with a Resource Directory. <xref target="discover-fig"/> shows an example of a client discovering a local pub/sub Function Set using CoAP Simple Discovery. A broker wishing to advertise the CoAP pub/sub Function Set for Simple Discovery or through a Resource Directory MUST use the link relation rt="core.ps". A broker MAY advertise it's supported content formats and other attributes in the link to it's pub/sub function set.
</t>

<t> A CoAP pub/sub Broker MAY offer the Discover interface to enable Clients to find topics of interest, either by topic name or by link attributes which may be registered when the topic is created. <xref target="discover-topic-fig"/> shows an example of a client looking for a topic with a resource type (rt) of "temperature" in the pub/sub function set /ps using the Discover interface. The client then receives the URI of the resource and its content-format.
</t>


<t>The DISCOVER interface is specified as follows:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Interaction:">Client -> Broker</t>
<t hangText="Method:">GET</t>
<t hangText="URI Template:">/.well-known/core</t>
<t hangText="URI Template:">/{+ps/}{topic}{/topic*}{?q*}</t>
<t hangText="URI Template Variables:">
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="/.well-known/core := ">for discovering the pub/sub function set (optional)</t>
<t hangText="ps := ">pub/sub Function Set path (optional). The path of the pub/sub Function Set, as obtained from discovery, used to discover topics.</t>
<t hangText="topic := ">The desired topic to return links for (optional).</t><t hangText="q := ">Query Filter (optional). MAY contain a query filter list as per <xref target="RFC6690"/> Section 4.1.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t hangText="Content-Format:">application/link-format</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>The following response codes are defined for this interface:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Success:"> 2.05 "Content" with an
application/link-format payload containing one or more matching entries for the broker resource. A pub/sub broker SHOULD use the value "/ps/" for the function set URI wherever possible.</t>
<t hangText="Failure:"> 4.04 "Not Found" is returned in case no matching entry is found for a unicast request.</t>
<t hangText="Failure:"> 4.00 "Bad Request" is returned in case of a malformed request for a unicast request.</t>
<t hangText="Failure:"> No error response to a multicast request.</t>
</list>

<section title="CREATE">
<t>Clients create topics on the broker using the CREATE interface. A client wishing to create a topic MUST use CoAP POST to the pub/sub function set location with a payload indicating the desired topic. The topic specification sent in the payload MUST use a supported serialization of the CoRE link format <xref target="RFC6690"/>. The target of the link MUST be a URI formatted string. The client MUST indicate the desired content format for publishes to the topic by using the ct (Content Format) link attribute in the link-format payload. The client MAY indicate the lifetime of the topic by including the Max-Age option in the CREATE request. Broker MUST return a response code of "2.01 Created" if the topic is created and return the created relative URI path via Location-Path options. The broker MUST return the appropriate 4.xx response code indicating the reason for failure if a new topic can not be created. Broker SHOULD remove topics if the Max-Age of the topic is exceeded without any publishes to the topic. Broker SHOULD retain a topic indefinitely if the Max-Age option is elided or is set to zero upon topic creation. The lifetime of a topic MUST be refreshed upon create operations with a target of an existing topic.
</t>
<t>
Topics may be created as sub-topics of other topics. A client MAY create a topic with a ct (Content Format) link attribute value which describes a supported serialization of the CoRE link format <xref target="RFC6690"/> such as application/link-format (ct=40) or its JSON or CBOR serializations. If a topic is created which describes a link serialization, that topic may then have sub-topics created under it as shown in <xref target="create-sub-fig"/>.

<section title="PUBLISH">
<t>A CoAP pub/sub Client uses the PUBLISH interface for updating topics on the broker. The client MUST use the PUT method to publish state updates to the CoAP pub/sub Broker. A client MUST use the content format specified upon creation of a given topic to publish updates to that topic. The broker MUST reject publish operations which do not use the specified content format. A CoAP client publishing on a topic MAY indicate the maximum lifetime of the value by including the Max-Age option in the publish request. The broker MUST return a response code of "2.04 Changed" if the publish is accepted or "4.04 Not Found" if the topic does not exist. A broker MAY return "4.29 Too Many Requests" if simple flow control as described in <xref target="sec-flow-control"/> is implemented.
</t>

<t>The Broker MUST notify all clients subscribed on a particular topic each time it receives a publish on that topic. An example is shown in <xref target="subscribe-fig"/>. If a client publishes to a broker with the Max-Age option, the broker MUST include the same value for the Max-Age option in all notifications. A broker MUST use CoAP Notification as described in <xref target="RFC7641"/> to notify subscribed clients.

<section title="SUBSCRIBE">
<t>CoAP pub/sub Clients subscribe to topics on the Broker using CoAP Observe as described in <xref target="RFC7641"/>. A CoAP pub/sub Client wishing to Subscribe to a topic on a broker MUST use a CoAP GET with Observe registration. The Broker MAY add the client to a list of observers. The Broker MUST return a response code of "2.05 Content" along with the most recently published value if the topic contains a valid value and the broker can supply the requested content format. The broker MUST accept Subscribe requests on a topic if the content format of the request matches the content format the topic was created with. The broker MAY accept Subscribe requests which specify content formats that the broker can supply as alternate content formats to the content format the topic was registered with. If the topic was published with the Max-Age option, the broker MUST set the Max-Age option in the valid response to the amount of time remaining for the value to be valid since the last publish operation on that topic. The Broker MUST return a response code of "2.04 No Content" if the Max-Age of the previously stored value has expired. The Broker MUST return a response code "4.04 Not Found" if the topic does not exist or has been removed. The Broker MUST return a response code "4.15 Unsupported Content Format" if it can not return the requested content format. If a Broker is unable to accept a new Subscription on a topic, it SHOULD return the appropriate response code without the Observe option as per as per <xref target="RFC7641"/> Section 4.1. There is no explicit maximum lifetime of a Subscription, thus a Broker may remove subscribers at any time. The Broker, upon removing a Subscriber, will transmit the appropriate response code without the Observe option, as per <xref target="RFC7641"/> Section 4.2, to the removed Subscriber.

<section title="READ">
<t>A CoAP pub/sub client wishing to obtain only the most recent published value on a topic MAY use the READ interface. For reading, the client uses the CoAP GET method. The broker MUST accept Read requests on a topic if the content format of the request matches the content format the topic was created with. The broker MAY accept Read requests which specify content formats that the broker can supply as alternate content formats to the content format the topic was registered with. The Broker MUST return a response code of "2.05 Content" along with the most recently published value if the topic contains a valid value and the broker can supply the requested content format. If the topic was published with the Max-Age option, the broker MUST set the Max-Age option in the valid response to the amount of time remaining for the topic to be valid since the last publish. The Broker MUST return a response code of "2.04 No Content" if the Max-Age of the previously stored value has expired. The Broker MUST return a response code "4.04 Not Found" if the topic does not exist or has been removed. The Broker MUST return a response code "4.15 Unsupported Content Format" if the broker can not return the requested content format.

<section title="CoAP pub/sub Operation with Resource Directory">
<t>A CoAP pub/sub Broker may register a pub/sub Function Set with a Resource Directory. A pub/sub Client may use an RD to discover a pub/sub Broker.
</t>

<t>A CoAP pub/sub Client may register CoRE Links <xref target="RFC6690"/> to created pub/sub Topics with an RD. A pub/sub Client may use an RD to discover pub/sub Topics. A client which registers pub/sub Topics with an RD MUST use the context relation (con) <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/> to indicate that the context of the registered links is the pub/sub Broker.
</t>

</section>


<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<section title="Sleep-Wake Operation">

<t>CoAP pub/sub provides a way for client nodes to sleep between operations, conserving energy during idle periods. This is made possible by shifting the server role to the broker, allowing the broker to be always-on and respond to requests from other clients while a particular client is sleeping.</t>

<t>For example, the broker will retain the last state update received from a sleeping client, in order to supply the most recent state update to other clients in response to read and subscribe operations.</t>

<t>Likewise, the broker will retain the last state update received on the topic such that a sleeping client, upon waking, can perform a read operation to the broker to update its own state from the most recent system state update.</t>

</section>

 
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<section anchor="sec-flow-control" title="Simple Flow Control">

<t> Since the broker node has to potentially send a large amount of
notification messages for each publish message and it may be serving a
large amount of subscribers and publishers simultaneously, the broker
may become overwhelmed if it receives many publish messages to popular
topics in a short period of time. </t>

<t> If the broker is unable to serve a certain client that is sending
publish messages too fast, the broker MUST respond with Response Code
4.29, "Too Many Requests". This Response Code is like HTTP 429 "Too
Many Requests" but uses the Max-Age Option in place of the
"Retry-After" header field to indicate the number of seconds after
which to retry. The broker MAY stop creating notifications from the
publish messages from this client and to this topic for the indicated
time. </t>

<t> If a client receives the 4.29 Response Code from the broker for a
publish message to a topic, it MUST NOT send new publish messages to
the broker on the same topic before the time indicated in Max-Age has
passed. </t>

<section anchor="SecurityConsiderations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>CoAP pub/sub re-uses CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/>, CoRE Resource Directory <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/>, and Web Linking <xref target="RFC5988"/> and therefore the security considerations of those documents also apply to this specification. Additionally, a CoAP pub/sub broker and the clients SHOULD authenticate each other and enforce access control policies. A malicious client could subscribe to data it is not authorized to or mount a denial of service attack against the broker by publishing a large number of resources. The authentication can be performed using the already standardized DTLS offered mechanisms, such as certificates. DTLS also allows communication security to be established to ensure integrity and confidentiality protection of the data exchanged between these relevant parties. Provisioning the necessary credentials, trust anchors and authorization policies is non-trivial and subject of ongoing work.</t>

<t>The use of a CoAP pub/sub broker introduces challenges for the use of end-to-end security between for example a client device on a sensor network and a client application running in a cloud-based server infrastructure since brokers terminate the exchange. While running separate DTLS sessions from the client device to the broker and from broker to client application protects confidentially on those paths, the client device does not know whether the commands coming from the broker are actually coming from the client application. Similarly, a client application requesting data does not know whether the data originated on the client device. For scenarios where end-to-end security is desirable the use of application layer security is unavoidable. Application layer security would then provide a guarantee to the client device that any request originated at the client application. Similarly, integrity protected sensor data from a client device will also provide guarantee to the client application that the data originated on the client device itself. The protected data can also be verified by the intermediate broker ensuring that it stores/caches correct request/response and no malicious messages/requests are accepted. The broker would still be able to perform aggregation of data/requests collected.</t>

<t>Depending on the level of trust users and system designers place in the CoAP pub/sub broker, the use of end-to-end object security is RECOMMENDED <xref target="I-D.selander-ace-object-security"/>.</t>
<t>
When only end-to-end encryption is necessary and the CoAP Broker is trusted, Payload Only Protection (Mode:PAYL) could be used. The Publisher would wrap only the payload before sending it to the broker and set the option Content-Format to application/smpayl. Upon receival, the Broker can read the unencrypted CoAP header to forward it to the subscribers.
